## Features

1. **Pulse Animation**:
   - A smooth, continuous animation that creates a glowing pulse effect around a circular element.
   - The animation scales and fades the glow over time, providing a dynamic visual effect.

2. **Gradient Background**:
   - A radial gradient background for the central circle, adding depth and style.

3. **Responsive and Centered Design**:
   - The pulse animation is fully responsive and centered vertically and horizontally on the screen.
